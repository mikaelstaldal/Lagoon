<h1>Lagoon</h1>

<p>Lagoon is an XML-based framework for web site maintenance.</p>

<p>Lagoon does not require support for any dynamic content technology,
such as Servlets, CGI, ASP, SSI, PHP or JSP, on the web server. It's
therefore very useful for sites on cheep web hotels which gives limited
(or no) access to dynamic content features. However, Lagoon is
useful larger sites too, and can be used together with other
dynamic content technologies.</p>

<p>Lagoon is also useful for building HTML based documentation bundles,
for viewing without a web server.</p>

<h2>Background and philosophy</h2>

<h3>The web server: Static and dynamic content</h3>

<p>The basic functionality of a web server is to send the content of a
regular file stored on disk as the response of a request, this is
called static content. The other alternative is to start a process
that generates the response for each request, this is called dynamic
content. The use of dynamic content can be divided into several
categories as follows.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Pseudo-dynamic</dt><dd>where the requested document is generated by
composing information from several files and/or from a database. The
information in the files and in the database is static, i.e. updated in
a controlled manner and not very frequently. This is called
<em>pseudo-dynamic</em> since the produced document is a function of static
information only. In principle, this use of dynamic content is not
necessary since the updates could have been done in static content. The
main reason for using this approach is easier maintenance and updates.
Technologies such as SSI, ASP, PHP and JSP are used for this.</dd>

<dt>Real-time data</dt><dd>where the generated document depends on some
information that is updated frequently and outside the control of the
web server. Technologies such as CGI and Servlets (sometimes also ASP,
PHP and JSP) are used for this.</dd>

<dt>User interaction</dt><dd>where the generated document depends on
parameters in the request and/or state information from previous
requests. Technologies such as CGI and Servlets (sometimes also ASP,
PHP and JSP) are used for this.</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is also possible to have combinations (such as both real-time data
and user interaction).</p>


<h3>Where Lagoon fits in</h3>

<p>Lagoon produces all your pseudo-dynamic content off-line, and send
the result to the web server as static files. This can give better
performance, since processing doesn't have to be done at each request.
This also gives you convenient pseudo-dynamic content on a web server
without explicit support for it.</p>

<p>Lagoon does <em>not</em> handle user interaction, you have to use
the conventional technologies for this. However, while using ASP, JSP
(or whatever) for the few pages with user interaction, you can still
use Lagoon for the rest of the site.</p>

<p>Lagoon can in some cases be used for real-time data, but this
requires a more complicated setup than usual.</p>

<p>In addition, Lagoon keeps track of all content for your web site,
including static files (HTML, images, etc.) and any files for user
interaction (ASP or JSP pages, CGI scripts, or whatever). Lagoon
automatically detects if any source file is updated and regenerate the
dependent content as necessary (and only when necessary). Lagoon can be
seen as a Make tool for web sites, you have the "source code" on your
computer, Lagoon performs "compilation" as necessary and stores the
"object code" directly on the web server (with FTP or SSH if the web
server is remote). This is especially useful if you have a large web
site and updates it over a slow dial-up modem connection; if you make
changes to only a few pages, only those pages are actually transmitted
to the web server.</p>
